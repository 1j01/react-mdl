# React-MDL

React-MDL is a set of React components build on top of the [Material Design Lite framework](https://github.com/google/material-design-lite).

Here are the list of components in this repo:

- [Button](/src/Button.js)
- [Card](/src/Card.js)
- [Checkbox](/src/Checkbox.js)
- [DataTable](/src/DataTable.js)
- [FABButton](/src/FABButton.js)

Feel free to submit PRs with others components or fixes. I'm building them while I develop another project so it depends on my needs. Currently, these components doesn't have the ripple effect.
